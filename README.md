# SIR Model Simulation in Python

SIR Model simulation a Python-based tool designed to simulate and analyze the dynamics of infectious diseases through the SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) model.

## Introduction

The SIR model is a simple yet powerful model used in epidemiology to understand the spread of diseases in a population. It divides the population into three compartments:

- **Susceptible (S):** Individuals who are not infected but can become infected.
- **Infected (I):** Individuals who are currently infected and can spread the disease to susceptible individuals.
- **Recovered (R):** Individuals who have recovered from the disease and are no longer susceptible to it.

This model easiest interpretation. In practice there are a lot of external factors
